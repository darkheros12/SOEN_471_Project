# SOEN_471_Project

Abstract:
This project is a dataset analysis on statistics related to soccer. More specifically, this dataset contains statistics
on 11 types of events in a soccer match, such as goals, shots, and passes, throughout 9,074 games and 941,009 events
from various European Leagues, which include the Premier League (England), Ligue 1 (France), Bundesliga (Germany), 
Serie A (Italy), and La Liga (Spain). The data collected are events spanning from the 2011/12 season until the 
2016/17 season. The objective of this project is to apply supervised classification techniques to classify 
shots taken by players based on their position on the pitch and predict which positions have higher chance of success 
(shots resulting in a goal).
