# SOEN_471_Project

## Abstract:
This project is a dataset analysis on statistics related to football. More specifically, this dataset contains statistics on over 18 000 players such as goals, dribbling, accuracy, shots, skills, and passes from data collect by sofifa.com. The data collected are stats spanning from the 2015 to 2021 season. The objective of this project is to apply supervised classification techniques to classify player's position based on their stats on the pitch and predict which positions have a higher chance of success. Nonetheless, a few sub problems will be explored. We will try to investigate general position for players if they are a defender, midfielder or attacker oriented. (stats resulting in the best position).

## Introduction:
#### Context:
Football is one of the biggest entertainments in the world. With more than 18 000 professional players across the world, it has become very hard to find players that could be a fit in a football club. As a fanatic of football, we pick an Interest of player's performance on certain position. Players tend to perform better in certain position than others.  There are many positions in football such as full-back, centre-back, sweeper, goalkeeper, wing-back, defensive-midfield, central-midfield, attacking-midfield, forward, winger and striker. All those positions have their effect on the game. Assembling a team with different position is essential to make a more fluid gameplay and bring out the best experience for the players. There are multiple factors that might affect the game such as player’s experience, formations, strategies etc. However, for the scope of this project, we will solely focus on positions.

#### Objectives:
The main objective is to use the player’s stats from 2015 to 2021 to predict potential player's position based on trained stats. This will allow potential coaches or football adept to use players in their best position.

#### Presentation of the problem to solve:
The current problem is coaches have difficult time to pick players based on their abilities. Often, they would put players in their unpreferred position because no one can fill those holes. During transfer session, it is often hard to find an adequate player to buy because of the uncertainty of their prefer position. Thus, this project is intended to solve the problem of future player based on previous trained models. It will predict of the player is fit for a certain position or not. 

#### related work:
There are a few studies using Machine learning algorithms to predict game potential outcome such as “A Machine Learning framework for sport result prediction”. They analyzed different model of ML focusing on ANN (Artificial Neural Network) to predict sport results. Another study made by Hengzhi Chen “Neural Network Algorithm in Predicting Football Match Outcome Based on Player Ability Index” is based on player abilities to affect a football game. It will predict the outcome of the game based on player’s abilities. Plenty of previous studies showed that neural network is crucial for predictions in sports.
