# SOEN_471_Project

Abstract:
This project is a dataset analysis on statistics related to soccer. More specifically, this dataset contains 
statistics on all the penalties taken during the 2019-2020 season in various European leagues, which include the 
Premier League (England), Ligue 1 (France), Bundesliga (Germany), Serie A (Italy), and the Champions League 
(European tournament). This dataset shows who is the scorer of the penalty, in which minute of the game it was 
scored, and also whether the penalty affected the outcome of the game significantly, amongst other things. The goal 
of this project is to find correlation between the minute in which each penalty was scored and whether it was a 
game-changing penalty, i.e changing the result from lose to draw or draw to win. A few dataset analysis techniques will
be used to find out various unknown results amongst other outcomes.
